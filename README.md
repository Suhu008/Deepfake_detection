# Deepfake_detection
This project is a custom-built deepfake detection system that uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)***, enriched with handcrafted features like **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)** and **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)**. An **Attention mechanism** is integrated to improve focus on significant facial regions.
